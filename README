# Balance Log Analysis

This project processes and analyzes subscriber balance sync logs for Calo. It helps generate a wallet report and identify anomalies such as overdrafts.

## How It Works

1. **read_logs.py**: Extracts all `transaction: {...}` blocks from `.gz` log files and writes cleaned data to a CSV.
2. **generate_wallet_report.py**: Parses the CSV, processes nested JSON, and exports it to an Excel report.

## üê≥ Dockerized Setup

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t balance-log-analyzer .
